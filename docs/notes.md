## Hypothesis

- Extending the work Working Memory and Learning
- Based on literature we believe memory formation plays a role in learning
- This learning affects the outcomes of future decision-making but when does it?
- Hippocampus has neuronal ensembles that oscillate within a theta frequency range (5-14 Hz)
- Nested in these theta cycles are gamma oscillations that coupled with theta by phase
- There is belief that these frequency couplings and it's pathway construction is crucial for attention


## Objectives and Outcome
Theta-gamma coupling facilitates the synchronization required for attentional mechanisms, thereby affecting the timing and efficacy of learning outcomes.
The coupling of gamma oscillations within theta cycles in hippocampal neuronal ensembles is critical for memory formation, which plays a significant role in learning processes and influences future decision-making.
A transparency in the dynamics of memory encoding, and retrieval through theta gamma coupling

### Statistical Measures
Between-group comparisons:
ANOVA to compare LFP metrics across different goups of trials in different brain regions.
Post-hoc analyses (e.g., Tukeyâ€™s HSD) to examine pairwise differences

### Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC):

To investigate the interaction between low-frequency oscillations (theta) and high-frequency activity (gamma) we used the method of assess the degree of modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of lower-frequency oscillations, and make a statistical Analysis:
Mean modulation index (MI) for theta-gamma coupling.
Distribution of PAC strength across brain areas.
PAC comparisons between groups, e.g., during active task vs. passive trials phases.
